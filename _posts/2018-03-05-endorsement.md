"Max is of the rare breed of innovators who combine optimism with perseverance -- not only will he change the world, he'll bring you along with him." <br> - Scout Sujyot 


"I'm supporting Max's work because I see he has the rare combination of knowledge, perseverance and commitment to create meaningful change in the world that is as rare as it is inspiring.  As a healthcare trainee, I see the need for HostHome and Gryd nearly every day and I can't wait to bring them to my home town of Buffalo, NY.  We need it!" <br> - Rachel Simpson, MD/PhD candidate at SUNY Buffalo
