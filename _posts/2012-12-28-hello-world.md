Hello! 

I'm Max Goodman. I'm a full-stack developer-in-training who was recently admitted to the Flatiron School in DC. The Flatiron School is the "Harvard Business School of coding" according to Katie Couric. 

The first ever cohort in DC has accepted me and generously provided a 50% scholarship to attend. I'm thrilled, however, I cannot afford the rest of the tuition. Here's what I can do: ask for help. 

To start next Monday, I need $2000 yesterday, then another $5500 to complete the tuition.
