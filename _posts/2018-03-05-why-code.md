I'm learning how to code so that I can change the world. Pure and simple. I want to end homelessness and make class mobility a reality -- internationally. I've spent 10 years on and off the street across the country, so I know what it's like to be unstably housed. I've been the closest to the problem and now I'm closest to the solution. 

I've helped house 21 people for over 75 nights with 3 other hosts, $1200, and 1-800 number last year within 2 months with [HostHome](http://www.hosthome.help/). Together, with my partner, we've interviewed over 40 people to validate our market as part of the National Science Foundation I-Corps program last fall. 

HostHome has been awarded 3rd at TechStars Startup Weekend - Civic Edition in Arlington in 2017, awarded a spot in the Hopkins Social Innovation Lab 2017-2018 Cohort, awarded National Science Foundation I-Corps grant, and raised a total of $6000.
